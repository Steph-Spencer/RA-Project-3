This is a web application created for Inhabitent using Angular2 from the quickstart.

 The app is currently broken due to errors related to routing that I have not succeeded in debugging and which prevents the components from loading.
 Because the components don't load I was unable to proceed with finishing connecting the service, fine-tune the styling, and adddress the remaining requirements.
 I did not deploy my app per Ed's instructions because I ran out of time and it seemed premature given the state of the project.
