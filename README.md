This is the third project in the RED Academy Web Developer Professional Program

This project is a web application created using Angular2 from the quickstart, written in TypeScript. 
It utilizes Angular2 components to generate the views required to display each section of the page. 
The Journals section incorporates a feed of blog entries retrieved from an API service call.
Users can also post new journal entries via an API.



 The app is currently broken due to errors related to routing that I have not succeeded in debugging, and which prevents the components from loading.
 Because the components don't load I have not yet proceeded to finish connecting the service or fine-tune the styling.
 I am studying additional Angular 2 tutorials and will take another run at this project once I have filled in the gaps in my knowledge.
